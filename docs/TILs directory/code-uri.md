# code from uri

Open and edit files in vscode from a web app or your browser bar. This is useful in the context of local web applications or documentation management.


- Try the following links in your browser to open your `/etc/apt/sources.list` file
```
[Edit /tmp/dummyfile on VSCode](vscode://file/tmp/dummyfile)
[Edit /tmp dir on VSCode](vscode://file/tmp/)
[Edit /tmp dir on VSCode](vscode://folder/tmp/)
[Edit /tmp dir on VSCode](vscode://whatever/tmp/)
```

- And here's the same in markdown links  

> [Edit `/tmp/dummyfile` on VSCode](vscode://file/tmp/dummyfile)    
> [Edit `/tmp` dir on VSCode](vscode://file/tmp/)    
> [Edit `/tmp` dir on VSCode](vscode://folder/tmp/)    
> [Edit `/tmp` dir on VSCode](vscode://whatever/tmp/)
