# glow

A markdown beautifier and indexer for the terminal. You can pin fav docs to be stored user-wide or inspect directory trees with MD files. You can also just open a MD file.

```
glow            # inspect dir
glow README.md  # inspect file
```

Inside `glow`, press `?` for a little tooltip.

You can set environment variables such as `$EDITOR` and `$PAGER` to enhance `glow`.
